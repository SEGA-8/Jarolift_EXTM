# Jarolift_MQTT

Controlling Jarolift(TM) TDEF 433MHz radio shutters via ESP8266 and CC1101 Transceiver Module in asynchronous mode.
Experimental version. Use at your own risk. For private/educational use only. (Keeloq algorithm licensed only to TI Microcontrollers)
This project is not affiliated in any way with the vendor of the Jarolift components.
Jarolift is a Trademark of SchÃ¶neberger Rolladenfabrik GmbH & Co. KG

This is the external I2C EEPROM and MQTT version of Jarolift_RX_TX_FHEM, which was originally developed to operate with the 
FHEM home automation server. You find the original FHEM version on the project's homepage.

### Prepare Arduino IDE and libraries

Download an install the Arduino IDE from [Arduino website](//www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
(as time of writing the current version is 1.8.5)

Locate your arduino sketch directory - this is `$HOME/Arduino/` in linux

Download and / or unpack this project folder to a subfolder of this sketch directory

Locate the user library folder of your arduino sketch directory

Default under linux: `$HOME/Arduino/libraries/`

* copy the folder `DoubleResetDetector` to the arduino library folder
* copy the folder `PubSubClient` to the arduino library folder
* copy the folder `KeeloqLib` to the arduino library folder
* copy the folder `simpleDSTadjust` to the arduino library folder
* copy the folder `E24` to the arduino library folder

### when updating from earlier Jarolift_MQTT releases

* in earlier releases, the folder `PubSubClient-2.6.09` was delivered. Make sure you remove `PubSubClient-2.6.09` from the library folder and put the current `PubSubClient` folder there!


### Compile

Open the Arduino IDE and open the project .ino file (`Jarolift_MQTT.ino`)
TODO write a more detailed description

#### Check the board settings
In menu "Tools" set the correct board type. If you have any kind of NodeMCU, the board
``NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module`` will probably work.

You may look at the wiki for [pictures of the modules](https://github.com/madmartin/Jarolift_MQTT/wiki/Devices) or at this [comparison of boards](https://frightanic.com/iot/comparison-of-esp8266-nodemcu-development-boards/).

There are two possible pitfalls when choosing the wrong board type or changing between board types:
* the LED on the board may work / not work - necessary for the LED heardbeat and Admin-Mode.
* take a look at the flash size and the SPIFFS setting - a changed SPIFFS setting needs a new upload of the SPIFFS data files and an existing configuration may be not be found on next boot, then it is initialized with default values.

Note on the LED on the board:

The following settings have proofed to work:

##### ESP Core 2.4.1 / NodeMCU v1.0/V2
* Board: "NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)"
* Flash Size: "4M (1M SPIFFS)"
* lwIP variant: "v2 Lower Memory"
* CPU Frequency: "80 MHz"
* Upload speed: "115200"

##### ESP Core 2.4.1 / NodeMCU v3 and WeMos mini & its clones
* Board: "WeMos mini D1 R2 & mini"
* Flash Size: "4M (1M SPIFFS)"
* lwIP variant: "v2 Lower Memory"
* CPU Frequency: "80 MHz"
* Upload speed: "115200"


Dont forget to set the correct serial port (Tools->Port) after plugging the USB connector of the NodeMCU into the computer.

Upload the compiled sketch into the NodeMCU. Second, you need to upload the files from the data directory into the SPIFFS area. This is only necessary on first use of the NodeMCU and then only after the content of the files has changed.


### Uploading files to SPIFFS (ESP8266 internal filesystem)

*ESP8266FS* is a tool which integrates into the Arduino IDE. It adds a
menu item to *Tools* menu for uploading the contents of sketch data
directory into ESP8266 flash file system.

-  Download the [SPIFFS tool](https://github.com/esp8266/arduino-esp8266fs-plugin/releases/download/0.3.0/ESP8266FS-0.3.0.zip)
-  In your Arduino sketchbook directory, create `tools` directory if
   it doesn't exist yet
-  Unpack the tool into `tools` directory (the path will look like
   `$HOME/Arduino/tools/ESP8266FS/tool/esp8266fs.jar`)
-  Restart Arduino IDE
-  Open the Jarolift_MQTT sketch
-  Make sure you have selected a board, port, and closed Serial Monitor
-  Select Tools > ESP8266 Sketch Data Upload. This should start
   uploading the files into ESP8266 flash file system. When done, IDE
   status bar will display `SPIFFS Image Uploaded` message.

### Setup instructions

The configuration of the Jarolift Dongle is stored in the EEPROM memory of the ESP8266. On first initialisation, when no configuration is found, it is initialized with some default values and the Dongle turns on the Admin-Mode.

In Admin-Mode, the blue LED on the ESP submodule is turned on and the Dongle creates an WLAN-Access-Point with the SSID `Jarolift-Dongle`, protectet with the WPA-Passwort `12345678`. Now you have 180 seconds (3 minutes) time to connect to the WLAN Accesspoint and visit the configuration webserver on

http://192.168.4.1

Admin-Mode quits after the 180 second timeout or when you restart the Dongle from the configuration webserver.

If you need the Admin-Mode later, just press the "Reset" button on the NodeMCU module two times within 10 seconds. This double-reset will be detected and the Dongle enters Admin-Mode again, showing this with the blue LED turned on.

The running Jarolift Dongle does some debug output on the serial console.
Console Speed is 115200 Bit/s


### Known issues

* after flashing the NodeMCU board, on the first run of the fresh flashed sketch, any kind of restart (through WebUI or after a crash) of the ESP8266 may not properly work, causes the NodeMCU board board to hang. On the serial monitor, you see output like
```

 [INFO] - Writing Config to EEPROM

 ets Jan  8 2013,rst cause:2, boot mode:(1,6)


 ets Jan  8 2013,rst cause:4, boot mode:(1,6)

wdt reset
```
* this is a hardware issue, solution: power cycle your NodeMCU after flashing, pressing the reset button is not sufficient

* sometimes opening the "system" page in the WebUI causes a crash (Exception 28) of the ESP8266. The cause is not found yet.
